# OVERVIEW
Responsibilities for this rotation are varied:
(A) preoperative evaluation and optimization for inpatients whenever we are consulted - we also do postoperative evaluations for the patients we follow or if we are consulted for concern of postoperative complication.
(B) scanning the add-on board each morning to identify particularly sick patients who may need optimization prior to surgery (discuss with the attending of the day regarding potentially sick patients). Or just call the scheduler (x6-0249) in the morning to ask which patients he/she would like you to see.
(C) bedside sedation for procedures in the ICU (i.e., EGD, colonoscopy, trach), stroke codes, or get pulled to cover OR cases if they are understaffed.
(D) attend daily code team huddle in E2 MICU at 7:30am. Airway pager backup and/or carry the airway pager if an anesthesia resident is not in either the MICU or PACU.
(E) point of Care Ultrasound teaching done with POCUS attending (on Ether) every Tuesday/Thursday from 10am to 12pm.
(F) lead a presentation on Friday at 11am - one week it's a journal article of your choosing, and the other week it's a case presentation. 15 min presentation, 15 min discussion. Your attending can explain these responsibilities in more detail as questions arise. If you didn’t get the link to the box folder with prior presentations email Summer (to avoid repeating recent presentations).

# PREPARATION:
(A) SPOK Mobile and Voalte (These are the main communication tools): make sure you sign in to SPOK everyday. If you prefer a physical pager, it can be picked up at the communication office down in the basement. 
--For Voalte, sign in as Role/SHC Junior Resident, Unit/SHC 300P OR and 500P OR, Teams/SHC Anes Perioperative Consult. 
--The periop pager (22637) should be automatically forwarded to you from 7:30 AM-5:00 PM but it is good to check on the first day (call 288 to forward).
-- If pager not forwarded automatically, email Summer Reid (summer16@stanford.edu) to request this.
(B) Patient list: Perioperative anesthesia has one primary system list that we all share (found under Stanford Health Care / MD Primary): Perioperative Anesthesia Consult Service. The system list “New Perioperative Anesthesia” (found under Stanford Health Care / MD Consults New) will show you patients with a periop consult order. But this is just for your reference. Until the primary page/call you with a formal consult question, you do not have to add them to our primary list and you do not have to see them.
Make sure you are under the context “CRITICAL CARE SPLTY” (preferred) or “ANESTHESIA PERIOPERATIVE MEDICINE”.
-- Patient lists: go to patient report  deselect Rounding Report and select Pt List Portrait  print 
-- You will not be able to print the patient lists unless you are in the Critical Care Splty context
-- The anesthesia library printers do not print from Epic. You can go to PACU or E2 and print the lists from there
(C) Consults: after you get a consult, add the patient to our primary list (+Add patient/right click and select treatment team/add Tt. Periop Anes Consult Svc/consulting service). Go see all the consults (never block/punt a consult), call your own consults if needed, staff the patient with your attending, communicate with the primary team with the final recommendations or if further testing is needed, and talk to the anesthesiologist
for the case if you feel that is necessary. Also just to facilitate the process, you may consider talking to patient’s RN if you need an urgent lab drawn or ECG done (can be found on Voalte or just call the unit front desk directly to ask for the RN), radiologists if you want to get a wet read quickly (the most common ones are:
Echo 650-498-1821, US 650-498-2401, CXR 650-725-8132).
-- For patients you are following, it is good practice to stalk the surgical schedule each day and touch base with the assigned anesthesiologist to do a warm handoff, especially for complex patients. This helps prevent cancellations for cases we have seen. 
(D) Documentation: after seeing a new consult, start a new consult note. Template can be found under SmartText: periop. If there are changes in management, put in a Consult Follow-up note. Usually patients can be taken off our list on POD#1 or #2 if there is no postoperative complication and need no further coordination. Put in a postop Consult Follow-up note (SmartText: postop anes) before dropping the patient. You'll follow these patients and update the list throughout the two weeks. Generally, our service does not do
preoperative evaluations for cardiac anesthesia patients (those undergoing aortic or cardiac surgery)
-- If the service is busy, touch base with your attending regarding whether to see all post-op patients 

# DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION (aka running a tight service)
Since we usually have a different attending everyday, we are the only continuity in this service during the two weeks. Run it like you are the primary MD. Here are some suggestions and workflow.
(A) Prepare a daily list first thing in the morning
a. Make sure the list is updated, and each patient has a summary line. Most primary services (medicine, ICU, gen surgery specialties) manage their own summary line, so you do not have to do it. But for a few services (i.e. psychiatry, neurosurg, gyn onc), they do not use summary lines. It is best for you put in a quick one-liner, so you and your attending can keep them straight.
b. Print out a list each morning (one for you and one for the periop attending). Select the “perioperative anesthesia consult service” list/ Patient Report/uncheck “rounding report”/check “Pt list portrait”/ Print. This will be the master list for you and your attending for the day.
(B) First meeting each morning is the Code Team Meeting, which takes place at 7:30am at the E2 ICU front desk in front E244.
--you will go to all codes in 500P, 300P, and LPCH adult codes if you are not in a procedure. The codes will automatically be forwarded to the periop pager. Call or text your attending en route to the code to let them know you’re going. 
(C) Round on all the post-op patients on your list, see all the leftover consults (the non-urgent consults that came after 4:30pm the day before). Finish/pend all the consult notes and post-op notes before 9am. Call the scheduler in the morning, and add any patients you will need to see for the MORs to the list. After your periop attending finish all the ECT cases for the day, you may run the list with your attending, and modify the plans
and notes as necessary.
(D) You will get paged for preop consults, bedside sedations, stroke codes throughout the day. Usually we cannot accept new consults or procedures after 4:30pm, because we will not be able to staff the patient with the attending past 5pm. However, if it is something truly urgent, there can be exceptions. If you get a new non-urgent consult between 4-5pm, add the patient to the list and see them first thing in the morning.
(E) POCUS teaching every Tuesday/Thursday, 10am-noon. Look up POCUS attending on Ether. You may defer any nonurgent consults until after teaching. If you get paged for bedside sedation or stroke code or code blue, let your periop attending know.
(F) Finish any PM rounds as necessary on your own. Run the list and staff any new consults with your attending again around 3-3:30pm, and make sure everything is tightened up. This will be the last chance to ask the primary team to put in any consults or procedures (i.e. TTE, CXR) for the day, as all other services will slow down quite considerably after 3:30pm.
(G) Clean up the list and go home 

# Airway Pager (new)
--You will sometimes be assigned to hold the 300P airway pager. This pager receives non-emergent airway requests, airway codes, and code blues. 
--Pick up the pager at 7AM from whoever had it overnight (usually the ICU resident)
--If you are holding the airway pager on Tuesday, hand it off to the 300P scheduler at 4PM so you can go to lecture. 
--There are airway bags in the anesthesia tech rooms. Good idea to look through one on your first day just to get used to where everything is. Don’t have to carry the bag the whole day; techs will bring an airway bag/box to codes.
--If you show up at an airway/code and don’t have the things you need (glidescope, airway box, etc) call the main tech number and they’ll bring it
--Code blue carts have basic intubating supplies, start setting up with these if you don’t have the airway bag 
--The ICUs also have intubating supplies 
--We are not part of the 500P airway algorithm and should not be carrying the 500P pager. If no one else is available to hold it, it should go to the 500P scheduler or highest call attending w/ a resident. 
--If you are holding the airway pager, you also should have the 500P elevator override key (on a yellow lanyard w/ CODE BLUE TEAM on it). This is passed off from resident to resident
